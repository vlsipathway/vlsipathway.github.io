        <p style="margin-top: 20px;">
            Our policy ensures fairness and transparency regarding the purchase of digital educational products.
        </p>

        <h3 class="h3" style="margin-top: 30px;">1. Refund Eligibility (Digital Courses)</h3>
        <p>Due to the immediate digital nature of our course materials (videos and downloadable content), **all sales are final** once the course access has been granted (i.e., once the customer receives their login key/link).</p>
        <p>A refund will be considered ONLY if:</p>
        <ul style="list-style: disc; margin-left: 20px;">
            <li>The course content is technically inaccessible due to an error on our part, and the issue cannot be resolved within 7 business days of notification.</li>
            <li>The course was purchased by mistake, and the customer **has not logged in** or **accessed any course content**.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3 class="h3" style="margin-top: 30px;">2. Non-Refundable Situations</h3>
        <p>We **do not** offer refunds in the following circumstances:</p>
        <ul style="list-style: disc; margin-left: 20px;">
            <li>If the user has accessed or completed any portion of the course material.</li>
            <li>If the refund request is submitted more than **7 days** after the date of purchase.</li>
            <li>If access is revoked due to violation of the Terms and Conditions (e.g., sharing login credentials).</li>
        </ul>

        <h3 class="h3" style="margin-top: 30px;">3. Cancellation</h3>
        <p>Course enrollment cannot be cancelled once the payment is processed and access is granted.</p>
